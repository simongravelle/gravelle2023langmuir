This repository is associated with [our 2023 publication](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00036) in Langmuir, in which we
investigate the properties of water confined withing salt crust using both NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations.

## Data and script

Python and GROMACS scripts are hosted in the DaRUS repository of the university of Stuttgart: see here for
[bulk systems](https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-3179), and here for [slit pores](https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-3180).

## Introduction

This page describes the investigation we conducted as part of the SFB 1313, in collaboration 
with the experimental group of Ilmenau in Germany. The goals of the investigation were to:

- better understand the properties of water confined within salt crusts, which are disordered porous media made of salt
- combine NMR experiments, which allow for probing the dynamics of water within a porous medium, with molecular simulations, a numerical method which allow to resolve the trajectories of water molecules, and their interaction with the salt surface
